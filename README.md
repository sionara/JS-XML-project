# JS-XML-project
An web app that informs users about the weather conditions at a particular football match.

APIs that will be used:

1. [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3)

The app will incorporate these two APIs to check what the weather is like for any football match. Users will be able to make informed decisions about buying tickets to that event.
